# SOD-modeling-cpp
recoding the model to create a c++ version of the SOD-model base on https://github.com/f-tonini/SOD-modeling.
This repository contains the c++ version scripts used to develop a stochastic landscape spread model of forest pathogen *P. ramorum*.

## The files
The main.cpp contains the main program to run.

## To run the model

You can use Linux to run the model in the following way.

Open an terminal and install dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev libnetcdf-dev

Download the model code as ZIP or using Git:

    git clone ...

Change the current directory to the model directory:

    cd ...

Compile:

    make

Run:

    ./a.out > result.txt
